  franco_prussian_fpw.3.d:0 "Following the vicotry over the [FRA.GetName] in the Franco-Prussian War, we are now at a position to also take territories, next to giving the [FRA.GetAdjective] Debts and taking some territory until the debts are paid back. The First territory we could take is the territory of Alsace Lorraine and Belfort. The Reichsheer has said those territories are necessary for further defense in later wars against france, while the chancellor Bismarck has said that taking Territory by the [FRA.GetAdjective] will cause a bad relationshsip which we shouldnt risk just now as such a new major state in the middle of Europe."

  franco_prussian_fpw.4.d:0 "Having annexed and integrated the new Reichsterritories of Elsass-Lothringen, we are at a position where we could also take the territories of Nazig-Epinal, which would make our border even more defensive, the Reichsheer says since we would have a longer river border. Bismarck still says we shouldn't take too much because if we do, the relations with not only [FRA.GetName] but also the international community will worsen to a point. If we take just one more meter of land, we will be in the middle of a great war of the European powers."

  franco_prussian_fpw.5.d:0 "Now, the high-ranking commanders of the Reichsheer, such as Moltke, have asked for the further annexations of all the African Colonies from the [FRA.GetAdjective]. Bismarck warns us that doing that will definitely ruin our relation with France to the last degree but also start a great war, which would be unavoidable at that point."

  italy_fpw.2.d:0 "Italian Prime Minister [ITA.GetLeader] has made us an interesting offer. The country will help us in the next major war, in exchange for us giving them the region of Venice. This would cause us to lose land, but avert the risk of fighting a two-front war."
