  austro_prussian_fpw.1.d:0 "[From.GetName] has decided to join us in the Austro-Prussian war."
  austro_prussian_fpw.1.a:0 "Großartig!"

  franco_prussian_fpw.1.t:0 "[FRA.GetName] has capitulated!"
  franco_prussian_fpw.1.d:0 "The [FRA.GetAdjective] leader [FRA.GetLeader] has reached out to our Chancellor [PRS.GetName], asking us for peace in our war. We think it is best to accept this preliminary peace, as not agreeing to peace now could prolong this war even more and cause more casualties."
  franco_prussian_fpw.1.a:0 "Great!"

  franco_prussian_fpw.2.t:0 "[PRS.GetName] has capitulated!"
  franco_prussian_fpw.2.d:0 "The Prussian leader [PRS.GetLeader] has reached out to us, asking for peace in our war. We think it is best to accept this preliminary peace since not going to peace now could prolong this war even more and cause more casualties."

  franco_prussian_fpw.3.t:0 "Question of the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine."
  franco_prussian_fpw.3.d:0 "Following the vicotry over the [FRA.GetName] in the Franco-Prussian War, we are now at a position to also take territories, next to giving the [FRA.GetAdjective] Debts and taking some territory until the debts are paid back. The First territory we could take is the territory of Alsace Lorraine and Belfort. The Reichsheer has said those territories are necessary for further defense in later wars against france, while the chancellor Bismarck has said that taking Territory by the [FRA.GetAdjective] will cause a bad relationshsip which we shouldnt risk just now as such a new major state in the middle of Europe."
  franco_prussian_fpw.3.a:0 "Bismarck is in the right."
  franco_prussian_fpw.3.b:0 "We can leave Belfort the French."
  franco_prussian_fpw.3.c:0 "We will take it all!"

  franco_prussian_fpw.4.t:0 "The Nanzig-Epinal Question."
  franco_prussian_fpw.4.d:0 "Having annexed and integrated the new Reichsterritories of Elsass-Lothringen, we are at a position where we could also take the territories of Nazig-Epinal, which would make our border even more defensive, the Reichsheer says since we would have a longer river border. Bismarck still says we shouldn't take too much because if we do, the relations with not only [FRA.GetName] but also the international community will worsen to a point. If we take just one more meter of land, we will be in the middle of a great war of the European powers."
  franco_prussian_fpw.4.a:0 "We should listen to Moltke."
  franco_prussian_fpw.4.b:0 "Bismarck is right."

  franco_prussian_fpw.5.t:0 "Annexation of the French Colonies."
  franco_prussian_fpw.5.d:0 "Now, the high-ranking commanders of the Reichsheer, such as Moltke, have asked for the further annexations of all the African Colonies from the [FRA.GetAdjective]. Bismarck warns us that doing that will definitely ruin our relation with France to the last degree but also start a great war, which would be unavoidable at that point."
  franco_prussian_fpw.5.a:0 "We shouldnt risk a Great War!"
  franco_prussian_fpw.5.b:0 "Who cares about the international stage?"

  italy_fpw.1.d:0 "Italian Prime Minister [ITA.GetLeader] is wanting to make an alliance with us because of our common enemy of Austria. We are trying to unify Germany, and they are trying to liberate Venice, so naturally it would make sense to befriend them."
  italy_fpw.1.a:0 "Of Course!"
  italy_fpw.1.b:0 "Decline the offer"
  italy_fpw.2.t:0 "Italy asks for Venice in exchange for their support"
  italy_fpw.2.d:0 "Italian Prime Minister [ITA.GetLeader] has made us an interesting offer. The country will help us in the next major war, in exchange for us giving them the region of Venice. This would cause us to lose land, but avert the risk of fighting a two-front war."
  italy_fpw.2.a:0 "Sure"
  italy_fpw.2.b:0 "No Thanks"
  italy_fpw.3.t:0 "We need to conquer Venice!"
  italy_fpw.3.d:0 "[PRS.GetNameDefCap] is at war with [AUS.GetNameDefCap], and this provides us with a great opportunity to liberate the region of Venetia from Austrian oppression. Many nationalist politicians are demanding that we declare war on Austria, as it would allow us to retake our rightful land in the name of helping Prussia."
  italy_fpw.3.a:0 "Uh OK"
  italy_fpw.3.b:0 "We shall declare war on Austria immediately!"
  italy_fpw.4.t:0 "The Prime Minister has resigned!"
  italy_fpw.4.d:0 "Due to his inability to conquer Venetia, Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader] has been forced to resign. It seems that Bettino Ricasoli is our new leader."
